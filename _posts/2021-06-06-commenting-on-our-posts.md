<h3>Commenting on our posts</h3>

Data Sapien has been created with an intention to reimagine knowledge sharing with intuitive visual imagery and interesting narratives. This site has been built using Jekyll, GitHub Pages, Chart-Studio from Plotly and Disqus which are all either available as open-source tools or being offered as a royalty-free service. 

The following are the core principles of Data Sapien:
* Share factual and experimental knowledge and code FOR FREE citing credible resources
* Use royalty-free media and openly available datasets from various institutions and Kaggle adhering to their distribution rights
* Never ask the readers for monetary contributions or to share their personally identifiable information
* Enable an inclusive environment without discriminating anyone on the grounds of race, color, gender, economic status and professional experience

In-order to uphold these principles, users are requested to post comments
* Which are respectable towards other users and relevant to the post
* Are NOT meant to harm users mentally or financially through verbal abuse, explicit media, threats and phishing
* Are NOT advertisements of a product or service, genuine or otherwise
* Are NOT part of a propaganda to defame any of the founder, the site or the users 

In order to comment on my posts, you are generally required to have an account with the Disqus platform. You could also post comments as a guest without an account by submitting a name (real name if you would like to) and fake email address along with your comment. I cannot access your email but would still recommend you to enter a fake email like "abc@def.com". Guest comments do not appear instantly as they are subject to clearance.

If you own any media used in my posts and believe there is some discrepancy in my adherence to your distribution policies, you can write to me at kiran.datasapien@gmail.com

Hope you understand the intentions of this blog and adhere to the usage policy. Users violating these terms will face consequences such as comment removal, termination of access and legal action in extreme cases, solely at my discretion.
