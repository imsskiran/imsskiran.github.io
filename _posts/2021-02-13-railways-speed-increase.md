<h3>Premise</h3>
There is a saying that time is money. In the transportaion industry, this saying cannot be more appropriate. If you are paid to transport objects or people between two fixed points, the faster you do it the higher will be the revenue, as there will be more time available for doing additional trips. And if you are a monopoly operating on a network spanning 68000 kilometres, even a marginal increase in speed can result in disproportionate increase in revenues. 

Citing the same reason for many years now, the Indian government has been putting forth the proposal to upgrade the operational speed on the Indian rail network. However, to a multitude of factors which include the enormous scale as well as the lack of intent, the proposals never gained much traction. But from the mid 2010s, this has changed, so much so that, solving this problem now looks more realistic than ever. In this post, let's discuss how the masterminds at Indian Railways are finally solving this problem with a realistic roadmap and serious committment.

The current operational speed is a maximum of 110 kmph which further reduces at locations with unstable terrains. But the existing rail network is capable of operational speeds upto 160 kmph. So, what's stopping the railways from operating at 160 kmph?

<h4>Safety</h4>
As the Indian Railways is one of the major mass transportaion systems in the country, safety must remain a superior priority. The number of accidents within the current operational spectrum is quite alarming. So, increasing the speed will most likely lead to a higher number of disasters.

The masterminds identified the following major roadblocks against achieving better operational safety:
* Human and animal trespassing on the tracks
* Presence of level crossings with roads with no supervision on traffic movement at many places
* Obsolete and incapable operational equipment such as the locomotives, rolling stock and control (signal) systems

Solving all these problems requires enormous amount of capital investment which the Railways, being a government enterprise cannot afford. So they have been targetting these problems in a phased manner spanning many years.

<h4>Avoid Trespassing</h4>
Since the inception, the railways has been investing in initiatives to promote the hazards of trespassing on the railway tracks. They even came up with laws and penalties against the same. But with a population of 1.3 billion and with the network laid over a rich biodiversity, trespassing is never eliminated entirely. In the event of a collision, the change in momentum can derail the train putting many lives at risk. Even in cases of minor collisions, the network can be blocked for several hours causing significant loss in revenue. So, the railways have decided to fence its entire 68000 km network - a rather old-school but viable option. But to construct and maintain will still remain as a significant challenge for years to come.
