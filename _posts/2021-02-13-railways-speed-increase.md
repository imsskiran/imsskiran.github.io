<h2>Prologue</h2>
<!-- Rail transport is special. It is statistically the safest and the most economical means of mass transportation, one that offers a fun and hassle-free experience, especially while travelling as a group. For all its benefits, one of the of rail transport in India is its tardiness.  -->
Indian Railways is among the top five rail operators in the world with a staggering $27 billion revenue, 1.5 million workforce and transports 8 billion passengers every year. Over its 170 year operational history, it enjoyed undisputed market share in public and freight transportation with its vast 68000 km network connecting every nook and corner of the country.

However, with the exponential rise in road infrastructure and the coverage of air transportation over the years, Indian Railways (IR) has been losing its market share to faster air and cheaper road transportations. IR is in the dire need for speed to remain competitive and sustainable in future. And to achieve the same, the LORG has laid down a massive modernisation masterplan and has been implementing the plan through exemplary innovation and engineering to solve some of the most challenging problems, at a scale perhaps no other rail operator in the world has ever attempted.   

<!-- Trains are statistically the safest and the most economical means of mass transportation. They are truly special as they offer a fun and hassle-free travel experience, especially while travelling as a group. Interestingly, researchers found that emotional and social attributes such as nostalgia are one of the strongest attributes backing travellers' preference for rail transport. Despite its merits, tardiness has been the biggest show-spoiler of rail transport in India.

<!-- If you had travelled by Indian Railways, you would instantly relate to the numerous unplanned stops and the unrealistic arrival schedule of trains. 
 -->
<!-- Fortunataly, travel by Indian trains is only going to get better in future. In a bid to modernise itself, the Indian Railways (IR), which is the monopolistic operator of trains in the country on a vast 68000 km rail network, is solving six major problems to improve the operational efficiency of trains. Let's discuss those problems and the IR's innovation & engineering behind the scenes. -->


<!-- If you spent some time playing video games at the dawn of the 21st century, it is quite likely that you are familiar with NFS. For those who aren't, Need For Speed is a popular car racing video game franchise with each game having race missions that involve bigger rewards and faster cars as one progresses towards completion. In order to keep winning, the player has to spend money to make the car faster or buy a faster car. With money comes more speed and with speed comes even more money.

Indian Railways has been playing a similar game on its quest to modernise itself. Increasing operational speed on a 68000 km railway network is a challenging game - one that involves six missions. Let's look at what those are and how IR is finally winning.

Indian Railways operates most trains at a maximum speed of 110 kmph. Despite having a rail network that accommodates faster movement of trains, IR could not increase the operational speeds due to the following challenges:
* Locomotives
* Rolling Stock
* Network capacity
* Level crossings and Trespassing  
<br>
<h3>Problem 1: Locomotives</h3>
---
<br>
Indian trains are powered by a detachable locomotive. Until late 2000s, its fleet of locmotives were predominantly diesel-electric since a vast majority of its rail network was unelectrified. The diesel locos rated with a power of 2500-3000hp were capable to haul a passenger train with 18 coaches at 120 kmph. But their inability to decelerate and accelerate faster limited the average speeds of many passenger trains to 40-50 kmph and freight trains to 25 kmph. IR produced more diesel and electric locomotives with 3000 - 5000hp power to haul longer trains at greater speeds but acceleration woes and presence of unelectrified sections in the route led to nominal increase in the average speeds.

A fleet of high horsepower electric locomotives can haul 24 coach passenger trains at 160 kmph with a fraction of operational costs required for a fleet of equally efficient non-renewable diesel-electric locos. Operationalising a fleet of 1000s of electric locomotives is a multi-year, multi-billion paradigm shift in IR's rail network, loco production, operation and maintenance, to be backed with huge volumes of (up)skilled personnel.

Despite the massive challenge, IR has embarked on this journey and has been comissioning electrified sections spanning 2400 km every year to become carbon-zero by 2030 with a fully electrified rail network. IR has invested heavily on research and development of the next generation of electric locomotives and produced units with power as high as 12000 hp. These locomotives are capable of running freight and passenger trains at 100 and 160 kmph respectively, effectively doubling their current average speeds.

<h3>Problem 2: Rolling Stock</h3>
---
<br>
The rolling stock of Indian trains (usually called as ICF coaches) has been designed to produce electricity required for HVAC systems on its own while in motion. This power generating equipment is located at the centre of the axles of the coach, which limits its operational speed to 110 kmph.

An existing alternative to the self-generation is the attachment of a  diesel-powered electricity generator, used to be done to premium trains to increase their speeds to 130 kmph. Addition of such power generator coaches to a passenger train will mandate the replacement of two exisiting passenger coaches, leading to decrease in capacity and revenues. More importantly, the ICF coaches have a lower safety rating at higher speeds with their tendency to flip in the event of disaster.

Hence, the rolling stock needs a major tehcnological and safety upgrade, which came in the form of LHB coaches. IR has acquired the technology from the Linke Hofmann Busch in Germany to produce LHB coaces locally. LHB coaches can be hauled at speeds upto 200 kmph and are designed to be flip resistant. The power supply problem though is still unsolved. With its fleet of locomotives set to become all-electric, IR has developed Head-on Generation (HOG) technology to transform and supply the electricity from the over head power lines to the coaches through locomotives.

<h3>Problem 3: Network capacity</h3>
---
<br>
<!-- With upgraded locomotives and rolling stock, IR will face a new challenge in operating faster passenger trains and relatively much slower freight trains on its already congested rail network. How to overcome the problem of congestion? Increase the speed of freight trains? Or reduce the freight traffic? -->
With the next generation of locomotives and rolling stock, passenger trains could be hauled at 160 kmph. The freight trains however can travel at most half the speed. Currently, passenger and freight trains travel together on the same tracks with provisions to loop the freight train out to make way for the faster passenger train, as they approach closer. The increase in the difference of speeds between passenger and freight trains:

* Leads to an exponential rise in the frequency of freight looping  
* Limits the addition of new passenger and freight trains to the network

Hence, the freight and passenger trains cannot travel together, faster. IR has found that the problem can be solved by expanding its network by a fraction, which would still be the biggest rail infrastructure project ever. The golden quadrilateral connecting its four major hubs is a part of the rail network spanning 8000km. This quadrilateral is found to have 70% of the freight traffic movement. With enormous freight volume moving on a fraction of the network, IR has found a viable solution in constructing a dedicated freight corridor (DFC) along the golden quadrilateral and its diagonals.

The new DFC is designed to run freight trains at twice the speed with double the freight, effectively replacing four freight trains from existing network. With modern equipment like high-rise OHE and GPS-based signalling systems, the DFC is touted to be an engineering marvel and the longest freight corridor ever built. 

With the new found additional capacity, the existing network is getting signalling upgrades to enable passenger train movement at 160 kmph with a headway of just 5-6 minutes.

<!-- IR will face a new challenge in operating faster passenger trains and slower freight trains on its already congested rail network. How to overcome the problem of congestion? Increase the speed of freight trains? Or reduce the freight traffic?


Upgrading the speeds of longer, heavier and potentially inflammable freight trains further on the existing rail network poses alarming threats to travel safety. IR cannot afford to operate fewer freight trains as freight movement generated 64% of IR's total revenue in FY2020 with an increasing trend whereas the passenger trains have been loss-making for years now.

<h3>Problem 4: Level crossings and Trespassing</h3>
---
<br>
Now, there is space and support offered by the network to enable faster movement of trains equipped with new locomotives and rolling stock. But the last of the challenges in the quest for speed arises due to the inevitable rendezvous of rails with roads. These are called as level crossings where the movement on roads is temporarily obstructed to enable the free passage of oncoming trains. With the trains becoming faster and more frequent and due to the rapid growth of traffic on roads, level crossings will pose greater safety threats by becoming the sources of restricted and unrestricted human and animal trespassing on the tracks. 

The only solution is to eliminate them once and for all by elevating either the rail or the road at the level crossing. There are 32000 level crossings across the network, a number so enormous that 30% of them were left unattended till 2018, let alone elevated. The level crossings are being replaced through the construction of road under bridges or road over bridges at a pace of 1200-1500 units per year since 2018. IR intends to fence the enitre golden quadrilateral in the near future and eventually its entire network from level crossings and trespassing.

<h2>Epilogue</h2>
Indian Railways is the centuries-old LORG with its legacy nearly undone by its tardiness and ageing operating procedure. Its turnaround in the last decade to become a modern government enterprise preparing to offer world-class service at humongous scale with ever growing safety record, commitment towards carbon footprint reduction and gender inclusivity, is nothing short of monumental and marks the return of the king of Indian transportation. 


<!-- Unmanned level crossings are the points of intersection of rails and road. Leaving them unattended is equivalent to leaving a major four-road junction unattended without signals. A faster oncoming train will have a higher chance of having a deadlier collision. IR has come up with an action plan to convert all unmanned level crossings to manned and eventually eliminate them once and for all through construction of overpasses and underpasses. After collecting dust for several years, the action plan papers are finally put to use from 2010s. IR has been able to finish this sub-mission by March 2020. 

Solving all these problems requires enormous amount of capital investment which is unaffordable the Railways as it is a government enterprise. Moreover, if they cannot maintain desirable travel safety with the present standard operating procedure, how could they do so by increasing the speed further? Therefore, safety is the achievement of the hour and they have done that exactly. The following stats quantify their efforts:

Having found some consistency in maitaining travel safety, they are gradually inching towards their goal by tackling the roadblocks in the following manner:
 -->

<!-- <h4>Avoid Trespassing</h4>
Since the inception, the railways has been investing in initiatives to promote the hazards of trespassing on the railway tracks. They even came up with laws and penalties against the same. But with a population of 1.3 billion and with the network laid over a rich biodiversity, trespassing is never eliminated entirely. In the event of a collision, the change in momentum can derail the train putting many lives at risk. Even in cases of minor collisions, the network can be blocked for several hours causing significant loss in revenue. So, the railways have decided to fence its entire 68000 km network - a rather old-school but viable option. But to construct and maintain will still remain as a significant challenge for years to come.

<h4>Eliminate level crossings</h4>
The elimination of unmanned level crossings has contributed towards improved safety to an extent. But the railways have realised that the removal of level crossings once and for all is the way forward to achieve safety with enhanced speed. For several years, railways have been constructing overpasses and underpasses at busier intersections. But from 2015, they swicthed gears in terms of conversion of level crossings which is shown by the following stats:

The cherry on the cake though is one such underpass construction, which was finished in a record time of 4 days as it was meant to happen at one of the busier sections in the railway network:

<h4>Modernisation of operational equipment</h4>
This is the most important and the hardest challenge that the Indian Railways has been fighting hard by investing heavily on technology and innovation. In a nutshell, speed is generated by the locomotives, speed has to be sustained by the rolling stock & the rails and speed is managed by the communication systems such as signalling. But do the railways possess capable equipment to attain the speed? The answer is "Not enough!"

Indian railways produces the locomotives and rolling stock on its own and it does possess semi-high speed capable equipment since 1995 but in miserably low numbers until mid-2010s. 

The locomotives below are known as WAP-5 and WAP-7 respectively which can comfortably pull a 20 (and 24) coach passenger train at speeds upto 200 kmph. 

These locomotives first entered the Indian Railways in 1995 (and 2001) and the table below provides the number of WAP-5/ WAP-7 locomotives in service over the years:

So how is the railways managing to produce drastically higher number of units since 2011? 

Indian Railways has a mix of electric locomotives powered by diesel and electricity. As of 2020, none of the diesel class of locomotives achieved a higher carrying capacity than WAP-7. For this reason and the added advantage of reduction in its carbon footprint, the railways has decided to electrify its entire network (and is well on its way to meet the deadline in 2023) and increased the production of electric WAP-7 locmotives dramatically, even at production centers meant to produce diesel-electric locomotives.

And for freight trains, they came up with WAG-12 and WAG-11 class of locomotives with monstrous power of upto 12000 HP. This a testimony of Indian Railways investment in green technology, as it joins the elite group of 6 nations in the entire world to have ever produced a 10000 HP+ locomotive.

<h4>Rolling Stock</h4>
Indian Railways have first inducted the Linke-Holfmann Busch (LHB) class of coaches in 2000. These coaches provide enhanced travel safety and more importantly they are flip resistant in the event of disaster. Flipping of coaches during accidents was found to be making the disasters more deadlier. But LHB coaches are significantly expensive to produce and for several years, these coaches were used only in premium trains due to low numbers of production.

Somehow by 2018, the railways cracked the code for mass production and decided to produce only the LHB coaches thereafter at all facilities, a welcome change towards enhanced speed and safety. Theoritically, LHB coaches can be tuned to attain speeds of up to 200 kmph. But the non-air conditioned class of coaches form signifcant portion of most Indian trains. These non-AC coaches have windows with open vents for air circulation that provide significant risks when operated at higher speeds. It seemed impossible to strip all non-AC coaches until September 2020, when IR came with a game-changing design of an air-conditioned coach with similar dimensions having enhanced capacity making up for the loss in revenue with reduction in fare. The railways is going to bet on the increased spending power of Indians to adapt to the AC class of travel in the future.
