<h3>Prologue</h3>

Imagine a person who is an alumnus of a reputed university with a well-paying job. Based on these two achievements, the world around him/her considers them successful. In reality, this person is a big-time procrastinator but has an ability to finish the job in the nick of time. Hence, his/her procrastination has never been in question so far. 

But this person is aware that lacking respect towards time would invite troubles some day. He/she has a belief that if they are already good in finishing jobs by spending little time, this good shall become great by spending a little more. But complaceny has taken them over to make any amends. As months pass by, they notice that life isn't as full-filling as it used to be, as they begin to succumb to boredom. 

The person wants to do more everday but lacks guidance or direction of what makes life more full-filling again. He/she is searching for a hack to enable seamless transition to more productive days. If you find this person relatable, here is that hack for you:

<h3>Epilogue</h3>
After reading the book, you might be wholly or partially convinced to try measurement. But here are a few facts to boost your motivation:

During the intial experimental streak of 100 days, the author has been able to spend time on his hobby, learning and additional outdoor tasks on `measured 83%` of days. Outside of his work and time with family, he authored this book, created this blog, finished 3 online courses and also volunteered with an NGO by diligently spending stipulated time for the scheduled hobby, learning and outdoor task slots.

If you are already quite productive, you are still recommended to try measurement to evaluate, maintain and imporve your consistency.
Thanks for reading my book and I hope you alloted a slot to finish the second chapter after reading the first. Have a great day in a measured way!
