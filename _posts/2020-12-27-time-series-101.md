<h3>Prologue</h3>
Time-series is a concept of statistics used in science and engineering verticals having temporal measurements. The fundamentals of time-series can be intuitively understood by drawing an analogy with a solar system. The center of the time-series solar system is its definition. The properties of time-series are like the planets around the centre and the applications of time-series are similar to the satellites revolving around these planets. To understand how and why, continue reading by acknowledging that you are familiar with basic statistical properties such as mean and variance.

<h3>The definition</h3>
---
<br>
<em>An ordered sequence of values of a variable at equally-spaced time intervals.</em>

In this definition, there are three important words that explain almost all important properties and applications. Those words are:
* ordered
* variable
* equally-spaced

<br>
<h3>Properties</h3>
---
<br>
The properties of time-series are grouped into three different tabs such that each tab contains the list of properties explainable by the word. Click on each tab below to go through the properties.
<br>  
<div class="tab">
  <button class="tablinks" onclick="showTabContent(event, 'Order')" id="defaultOpen">ORDER</button>
  <button class="tablinks" onclick="showTabContent(event, 'Variable')">VARIABLE</button>
  <button class="tablinks" onclick="showTabContent(event, 'Equally-spaced')">EQUALLY-SPACED</button>
</div>

  <h4 style="color: #2D59B7;">Auto-correlation</h4>
 In traditional statistical analysis such as Regression, a variable contains a sequence of observations that are assumed to be independent of each other. Hence the order of values is irrelavant. But in a time-series sequence, the observations may not be independent as the dependence is established through time dimension. The values observed at a time T can be related to those observed before and after T. 
<br><br>
 This phenomenon is called Auto-correlation and it is the quantitative measurement of the similarity between the time-series and its lagged version over successive time intervals. Therefore, the order of values of a time-series is prominent and unchangeable.

 In the plot above, the crests and troughs occur at time periods that are multiples of 7. There is a high <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence">correlation</a> between the values of time series X<sub>t</sub> and the series X<sub>t-7</sub> obtained by taking the 7th preceding value for each value of X.

Time-series is a random variable often with meaningful summary statistics. The following are some characteristic properties of defined as a function of mean and variance.
<br>
<br> 
<h4 style="color: #2D59B7;">Stationarity</h4>
A time-series is said to be stationary if its mean and variance do not change with time. In the plot below, it can be noticed that time-series values vary within a bounded range over a fixed period of time. This can be quantitatively verified by computing mean and variance over shorter time-periods within the measurement period. Stationarity can be statistically verified by performing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dickey%E2%80%93Fuller_test">Dickey-Fuller</a> statistical test. 
<br><br>
The following plot shows the hourly temperature measurements of a furnace in a controlled industrial setup. The time-series appears to be stationary.

<br><br>
Stationarity plays a prominent role in time-series analysis. In literature and practice, many variants of stationarity are dealt with and are broadly classified into strong and weak stationarities. Time-series with temporally constant summary statistcs are termed to have strong stationarity whereas those having some properties changing with time are termed to have weak stationarity. In such cases, it is sometimes possbile to <a href="https://machinelearningmastery.com/remove-trends-seasonality-difference-transform-python/">transform</a> or decompose the time-series to obtain stationarity. As this is a primer, the scope is limited to scratch the surface and if you wish to learn more, you can get started with this <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/stationarity-in-time-series-analysis-90c94f27322">detailed post on stationarity</a>
<br>
<br>
<h4 style="color: #2D59B7;">Trend</h4>
Time-series values might follow a curve with a positive or negative slope over an extended period of time or the enitre time-period of measurement. In such cases, the mean changes with time and the time-series is said to be having an increasing or decreasing trend. 
<br><br>For example, consider the monthly retail sales in the US for the last many years which seems to be having an overall increasing trend. The two major dips can be correlated to the reduction in consumers' spending power during the events of economic recession in 2008 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

<h4 style="color: #2D59B7;">Seasonality</h4>
If time-series values at certain timestamps significantly differ from the remaining values and if all such timestamps have any of the same calendar attributes such day of year, day of month, day of week and time of day among others, then the time-series is said to be having seasonality. The variance of time-series changes due to these periodic fluctuations.

A time-series is said to be having seasonality if the variance changes with time due to periodic fluctuations in the values. The quantity of ice-creams produced throughout the year is a vanilla example of seasonality. As the demand for ice-creams peaks during summer and dips during winter, we notice a corresponding pattern of increase in production till summer and decerase thereafter until winter. Every year the production peaks in June and dips in December. This is a time-series with yearly seasonality.

<div id="Equally-spaced" class="tabcontent">
 <h4 style="color: #2D59B7;">Periodicity</h4>
Periodicity is frequency of occurence of values of time-series. It is generally yearly, quarterly, monthly, weekly, daily, hourly or sub-hourly. It is computed by measuring the time difference between consequent values of time-series. Presence of missing values can cause ambiguity in determining periodicity and the series can be aggregated to larger units of time to make periodicity deterministic, if such transformation still suits the purpose.
<br>
<br>
<h4 style="color: #2D59B7;">Non-cyclic Seasonality</h4>
Time-series can sometimes have aperiodic fluctuations changing the variance. These fluctuations can occur due to the aperiodic nature of deterministic effects such as holidays, elections and others. These aperiodic fluctuations can become periodic by aggregating the series to a larger unit of time, making the variance explainable by time.

<h3>Applications</h3>
---
<br>
 <p>
 These properties of time-series are termed characteristic as they bring a sense of identity to the variable. Several time-series variables can be clustered into groups based on their properties, say variables with increasing trend, variables with strong yearly seasonality, variables that are intermittent among others. Statistical or machine learning models can be trained to learn these properties of time-series from historical observations to predict values to be observed in the future. And eventually after observing the actual values, they can be compared with the predictions to detect outliers. In standard nomenclature, the problems where concepts of time-series can be applied are:
<ul>
<li><strong>Exploratory Research</strong> <br>in situations like customer/product segmentation, interpreting weather etc.</li>
<li><strong>Future Prediction</strong> <br>in planning situations like forecasting demand, capacity, weather and stock-price</li>
<li><strong>Anomaly Detection</strong> <br>in monitoring situations like preventive maintenance</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h3>Epilogue</h3>
That's how the properties of time-series can be explained by centering around its definition and the applications are anyway centered on one or more of these properties. This is why the primer draws analogy with a solar system and if you wish to explore the planets or satellites further, you can use the following spaceships:
