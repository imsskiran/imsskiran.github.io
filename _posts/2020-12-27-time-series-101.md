<h3>Prologue</h3>
Time-series is a concept of statistics used in domains of science and engineering having temporal measurements. The fundamentals of time-series can be understood as a solar system with the definition at the centre, the properties as planets revolving around the centre and the applications as satellites revolving around the planets. To know how, continue reading by acknowledging that you are familiar with basic statistical properties such as mean and variance.

<h3>Definition</h3>
---
<br>
<em>An ordered sequence of values of a variable at equally spaced time intervals.</em>

Read between the lines and the three magic words below explain the properties and applications:
* ordered
* variable
* equally spaced

<h3>Properties</h3>

<pre> <strong style="color: #E93223;">ORDER</strong>                        VARIABLE                        EQUALLY SPACED</pre>
<h4 style="color: #2D59B7;">Auto-correlation</h4>
 The values of a time-series can be similar to those observed in the past. Auto-correlation is the quantitative measurement of this similarity between the time-series and its lagged version over successive time intervals.


 In the plot above, the crests and troughs occur at time periods that are multiples of 12. There is a very high [correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence) between the values of time series X<sub>t</sub> and the series X<sub>t-12</sub> obtained by taking the 12th preceding values of values of X. 

 Therefore, the order of values is significant and unchangeable.

<pre> ORDER                        <strong style="color: #E93223;">VARIABLE</strong>                        EQUALLY SPACED</pre>
Time-series is a random variable often with meaningful summary statistics. Like many statistical distributions, there are some characteristic properties of time-series defined as a function of mean and variance. 
<h4 style="color: #2D59B7;">Stationarity</h4>
A time-series is said to be stationary if its mean and variance do not change with time. 

Stationarity can be verified by plotting a line chart or by performing [Dickey Fuller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dickey%E2%80%93Fuller_test) statistical test. Stationarity is sometimes assumed or attained by [transforming](https://machinelearningmastery.com/remove-trends-seasonality-difference-transform-python/) the time-series. However, most real-world time-series are non-stationary with mean and variance changing with time. The next set of properties are based on this notion of time explaining the change in mean and variance.

<h4 style="color: #2D59B7;">Trend</h4>
A time-series is said to be having an increasing or decreasing trend if the mean increases or decreases with time.

<h4 style="color: #2D59B7;">Periodic Seasonality</h4>
A time-series is said to be having seasonality if the variance changes with time due to periodic fluctuations in the values.

<pre> ORDER                        VARIABLE                        <strong style="color: #E93223;">EQUALLY SPACED</strong></pre>

<h4 style="color: #2D59B7;">Periodicity</h4>
Periodicity is frequency of occurence of values of time-series. It is generally yearly, quarterly, monthly, weekly, daily, hourly or sub-hourly. It is computed by measuring the time difference between consequent values of time-series. Presence of missing values can cause ambiguity in determining periodicity and the series can be aggregated to larger units of time to make periodicity deterministic, if such transformation still suits the purpose.
<pre> ORDER                        <strong style="color: #E93223;">VARIABLE</strong>                        <strong style="color: #E93223;">EQUALLY SPACED</strong></pre>
<h4 style="color: #2D59B7;">Aperiodic Seasonality</h4>
Time-series can sometimes have aperiodic fluctuations changing the variance. These fluctuations can occur due to the aperiodic nature of deterministic effects such as holidays, elections among others. These aperiodic fluctuations can become periodic by aggregating the series to a larger unit of time, making the variance explainable by time.

<h3>Applications</h3>
---
<br>
 Time-series with all these properties have many applications ranging from discovering the patterns causing variance, building statistical models to predict the patterns in the future and monitor the deviation of actual observation from the prediction made earlier. In technical terms, the applications are:
* Pattern Recognition
* Future Prediction
* Anomaly Detection

<h3>Epilogue</h3>
That's how the many important properties of time-series are revolving around the three words in the definition. The applications are based on one or more of these properties making them satellites around the planets. The following are the resources for additional reading:
