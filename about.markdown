Every domain can be imagined as a mythical world containing the facts, examples and applications. Data Sapien shall bring such worlds to life using visual imagery and textual description entangled with pop culture references. This blog shall try to enhance the understanding of the big picture behind the conception of a theory, by making it relatable to something ubiquitous. Data Sapien is the unison of Knowledge, Graphic design and Screenwriting.

You might wonder "how?". Well, if you were to read "neuron is activated using a sigmoid function", you would have to imagine how it happens to understand the statement. To augment your imagination, the blog posts would contain a set of images visually narating how it happens. The visual is created using Graphic design and narrative is built with Screenwriting techniques.

Data Sapien will have posts on advanced topics and practitioner problems from the field of Data Science and AI. There will be occasional informative posts on large organisations (LORGs), wildlife, automobiles and personal technology. Explore away in a measured way! 

<h3> About the founder </h3>
[Kiran S. Sripada](https://linkedin.com/in/kiran-sripada-5a35b1a5) works as a Research Scientist at American Express and is a graduate from [Indian Institute of Technology Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in). He is curious to learn the rationale behind the conceptulisation of theory along with the theory itself, as he believes doing so will enhance his understanding as well as his ability to apply in the right situations. For many years now, he has been experimenting to simplify technical presentations using analogies and visual imagery.
