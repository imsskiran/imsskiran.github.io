Every domain can be imagined as a mythical world containing the facts, examples and applications. Data Sapien shall bring such worlds to life using visual imagery and textual description entangled with pop culture references. This blog will try to enhance the understanding of the big picture behind the conception of a theory by making it relatable to something ubiquitous. Data Sapien is the unison of Knowledge, Graphic design and Screenwriting.

You might wonder "how?". Well, if you were told "neuron is activated using a sigmoid function", you were just informed the fact or the process. Then you will have to imagine how it happens on your own. To augment your imagination, the blog posts would contain, often an image, to visually narate how it happens. The visual is created using Graphic design and narrative is built with Screenwriting techniques.

Still unclear? here is the sample - the activation of neuron is the transformation of incoming vector using the sigmoid formulation. This is relatable to Thor's suit in the image below captured when he arrived in Wakanda. It signifies the conversion of his physical strength to lightning. Visually the illuminated circles resemble activated neurons. The neural activation converts the N dimensions of input vector into one.

Data Sapien will have posts on advanced topics and practitioner problems from the field of Data Science and AI. There will be occasional informative posts on Large organisations (LORGs), wildlife, automobiles and personal technology. Explore away in a measured way! 

<h3> About the founder </h3>
[Kiran S. Sripada](https://linkedin.com/in/kiran-sripada-5a35b1a5) works as a Research Scientist at American Express and is a graduate from [Indian Institute of Technology Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in). He is curious to learn the rationale behind the conceptulisation of theory along with the theory itself, as he believes doing so will enhance his understanding of theory as well as his ability to apply it in the right situations. For many years, he has been experimenting to simplify technical presentations using analogies and visual imagery.
