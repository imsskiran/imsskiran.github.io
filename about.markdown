Data Sapien has been created with an objective to reimagine knowledge sharing with the help of graphic design and screenwriting to present the theory, examples and aplication as a story. You might wonder "how?". Well, if you were to read "neuron is activated using a sigmoid function", you would have been presented with just the fact and have to imagine how it happens on your own. 

This is where we intend to use, often an image, to show how it happens. The image is either created or modified by us, which is the graphic design part and presenting the facts by describing everything related to them, so that you see them the way we do, is the screenwriting part.

Data Sapien will have posts on advanced topics from the field of Data Science and AI. There will be occasional informative posts on Indian Railways, wildlife, automobiles and smartphones. Explore away in a measured way!

<h3> About the founder </h3>
[Kiran S. Sripada](https://linkedin.com/) works as a Data Scientist at American Express and is a graduate from [Indian Institute of Technology Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in). He is curious to learn the rationale behind the conceptulisation of theory along with the theory itself, as he believes doing so will enhance his understanding of theory as well as his ability to apply it in the right situations. For many years, he has been experimenting to simplify technical presentations using analogies and visual imagery.
