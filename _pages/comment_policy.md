Data Sapien has been created with an intention to reimagine knowledge sharing with intuitive visual imagery and interesting narratives. This site has been built using free and open-source tools such as Jekyll, GitHub Pages, Chart-Studio from Plotly and Disqus. 

The following are the core principles of Data Sapien:
* Share factual and experimental knowledge/ code FOR FREE citing credible resources
* Use royalty-free media and openly available datasets from various institutions and Kaggle adhering to their distribution rights
* Enable an inclusive environment without discrimination on the grounds of including but not limited to race, color, gender, economic status and professional experience
* Shall never ask readers for monetary contributions or to share their personally identifiable information

In-order to uphold these principles, users are requested to not post any comments
* That contain opinions which are hurtful towards other users or factual information without a valid source
* That are meant to harm users mentally or financially through verbal abuse, explicit media, threats and phishing
* That are advertisements of a product/ service, genuine or otherwise
* That are part of a propaganda to defame the founder, the site and the users 

Users are always welcome to point any misconceptions and factual errors that may have unintentionally appeared in our posts. If you own any media used in our posts and believe there is some discrepancy in our adherence to your distribution policies, you can write to us at kiran.datasapien@gmail.com

Hope you understand this comment policy and strictly adhere to it. You are hereby informed that violating so will lead to consequences ranging from removal of your comments, blocking you from using this site further to legal action in extreme cases, solely at the discretion of the founders.
